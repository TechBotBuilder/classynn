Object-based neural network with a GUI

This is an inefficient tool to help visualize and explore the concepts involved in common artificial neural networks.
It also aims to allow for rapid experimentation and visualization of new ideas.


## Instructions
Run 'python gunit.py' in a terminal. Create units by clicking on the canvas with a type of unit selected; configure units by clicking on them. The unit configuration also allows you to add one-directional connections, aka weights, from that unit to other units. When you are satisfied with the network, put data on each input unit and set targets for each output unit. Click 'Run forward pass', and when that is finished, 'Run backprop pass'. You can change the speed of these operations in the 'speed' bar.
